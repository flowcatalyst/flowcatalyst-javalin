-- Each application delivers its own outbox with its own service-account
-- credentials, so the built-in platform:application-service role now carries
-- the three batch-ingest permissions (Go 9c9986a, migration 069). The seeder
-- only inserts a built-in role when it is missing (it never rewrites an
-- existing role's permissions), so existing deployments pick the grants up
-- here, once. The ingest routes confine an application-scoped caller to its
-- own applications' items, so the grants do not widen reach.
