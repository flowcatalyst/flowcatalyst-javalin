# Conformance corpus

What a router **should** do with a mediation response, in a form that fails.

Language-neutral, so both implementations can run it for as long as both
exist — but this is **not a Go-compatibility harness**, and the distinction is
the whole point. Where the two differ, the corpus asserts the behaviour that
is right on the merits and records the other as a defect. Three rows already
do; a fourth (`config-error-501`) was added when this corpus caught Java
retrying a "Not Implemented" target for ever.

Freezing Go's behaviour as the definition of correct would make the port
inherit every defect the port was a chance to fix, and would make the harness
actively harmful: it would fail Java for being right.

## Why this exists

Two test suites written separately against the same prose agree only by luck.
`docs/spec/router.md` §6 has a precise outcome table that was the source of
truth for a dozen decisions, and until now nothing checked that either
implementation still matched it — the table could drift from both.

This corpus is that table, made executable — and then argued with. Several
rows now carry the reasoning for *why* the behaviour is right, independent of
either implementation, because a rule extracted from a Go source file is
evidence of what Go does and not of what is correct.

It is also the only artefact here that bears on the claim "drop-in
replacement". A row that passes in Java and fails in Go is a behaviour change
that will reach production at cutover; today nothing else would find it. But
"differs from Go" is a question, not a verdict — the row says which answer is
right.

## Design constraints

Every case is stated as **an HTTP response or a named precondition** — never
as a call into either implementation. No Java types, no Go types, no
assumptions about internal structure. A runner needs only to be able to:

1. stand up a local HTTP server it controls,
2. point a mediation target at it,
3. call its own mediator,
4. read back the outcome, the disposition, and the breaker's counters.

## Case shape

```jsonc
{
  "id": "config-error-404",           // stable; referenced in commit messages
  "spec": "§6 outcome table row 8",   // optional: where the rule is written
  "why": "…",                         // optional: the reasoning, not the rule
  "given": { "kind": "response", "status": 404, "body": "", "headers": {} },
  "expect": {
    "outcome":      "ErrorConfig",    // the outcome kind's name
    "statusCode":   404,
    "delaySeconds": 30,               // optional; omit where it is not fixed
    "flushGroup":   true,             // optional
    "httpCallMade": false,            // optional; for cases that must NOT call
    "disposition":  "UNDELIVERABLE",  // what happens to the MESSAGE
    "breaker":      "success",        // success | failure | neither | none
    "metric":       "failure"         // success | failure | transient
                                      //   | rateLimited | none
  },
  "divergence": { … }                 // optional; see below
}
```

### `given.kind`

| kind | The runner must |
|---|---|
| `response` | answer the next request with this status, body and headers |
| `unreachableTarget` | point the target at a port nothing is listening on |
| `malformedTargetUrl` | use a target URL with no host |
| `unsupportedMediationType` | set the message's mediation type to something other than HTTP |
| `breakerOpen` | drive the breaker for this target to OPEN before delivering |

### `disposition` — the field that matters most

`outcome` is the implementation's own vocabulary; `disposition` is what
actually happens to the message, and it is the safety property:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DELIVERED` | acknowledged; gone from the broker |
| `RETRY_IN_PLACE` | kept, retried here, position preserved |
| `RETURN_TO_BROKER` | handed back; the broker owns the retry |
| `REJECTED` | given up on and acknowledged away |
| `UNDELIVERABLE` | can never succeed as addressed; acknowledged away |

Two implementations may reasonably disagree about the outcome *name* and must
never disagree about this. Where they do, a message is lost or duplicated.

## Divergences

A `divergence` block records a row where the implementations differ. It must
carry:

- `correct` — `java`, `go`, or `both`. Which side the row asserts.
- `basis` — **why that answer is right**, argued from the behaviour itself and
  not from either codebase. This is the field that keeps the corpus honest: a
  divergence whose only justification is "the other one does it differently"
  has not been thought about.
- what the other implementation does, and where its fix is tracked.

`correct: "both"` is for cases where the outcome *name* differs for a benign
reason but the disposition — the message's actual fate — is identical.

If you cannot write `basis`, the row is an open question. Say so and leave it
unasserted rather than picking a side by default; the default would be Go, and
that is exactly the bias this corpus exists to avoid.

Current entries:

| Case | Correct | Nature |
|---|---|---|
| `success-carries-real-2xx-status` | java | The status is the target's own answer; flattening 201/202 to 200 discards information irrecoverably. Go fix tracked in `docs/spec/router-fixes.md`. |
| `unfollowed-3xx-is-permanent` | java | Retrying reproduces the redirect for ever and following it drops the body. Go retries indefinitely. Owner ruling 2026-08-24. |
| `unexpected-status-1xx` | both | Client-library artefact: Go's client surfaces the 1xx as final, `java.net.http` refuses to and fails the exchange. Both reach `RETURN_TO_BROKER`, 30s, breaker failure. |

Not a divergence, but found by this corpus: `config-error-501`. Java was
treating 501 as an ordinary 5xx and retrying for ever, because the `>= 500`
branch was tested before anything could special-case it.

## Running it

**Java** — part of the default build, no profile or tag:

```
mvn -pl server test -Dtest=MediationConformanceTest
```

**Go** — not yet written. The runner is roughly fifty lines: load the JSON,
`httptest.NewServer` per case, call `Mediate`, compare. It belongs in the Go
repo and should read this file by path rather than copying it, so the two can
never drift.

## Adding a case

Add it when a rule is *decided*, not when code is written — a case authored
from the implementation only restates it, and a case authored from the Go
source restates Go.

Give the row an `id` that says what it pins. Where the rule is surprising, put
the argument in `why`, not just the rule: `config-error-404` records a breaker
**success**, and every reader's first instinct is that it should be a failure.
The reason it is not — a breaker detects an unhealthy *target*, and a target
rejecting a bad request promptly is working perfectly — is the part worth
writing down, because it is what tells the next person whether a new case
belongs on that side of the line.
